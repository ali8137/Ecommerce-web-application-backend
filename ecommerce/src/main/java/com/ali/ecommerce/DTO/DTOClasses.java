//   of the backend side of the application, and between the backend side and the frontend side.
// - DTO classes are mainly used
//   to represent the data of the incoming requests from the frontend side and the data of the outgoing responses from the backend side.
//   they can also be used
//   to retrieve a specific set of table fields/attributes from the database to the backend server.


// - note: don't add category class inside a package named "requestDTO" or
//  "requestResponseDTO", "requestAndResponseDTO". not sure why though.
